This provides MyDef::output_www module.

PREREQUISITE
============

MyDef (https://github.com/hzhou/MyDef) has to be installed and environment variable MYDEFSRC has to be set and point to MyDef source directory.

FIRST TIME INSTALL
==================

    mydef_run

This will create and initialize the perl package folder MyDef-output_wwww/ and create Makefile.

    touch output_www.def

The newly created MyDef-output_www/ folder contains output_www.pm that is newer than output_www.def. It is necessary to touch the def source file to trigger make to compile the def source.

    make

This compiles and produces perl files.

    cd MyDef-output_www
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

Standard perl package build.

    cd ..
    mydef_make

Refresh the Makefile so "make all" and "make install" will work.

REFRESHING INSTALL
==================

Unless new def or new perl output is added, you can simply use

    make
    make all
    make install

to recompile and reinstall.
